## _Finding the Best Real Estate Investments for Tech Professionals_

### Introduction
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics:  
          "*Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 546,200 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security.  
          The median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $88,240 in May 2019, which was higher than the median annual wage for all occupations of $39,810.*"(https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm)
  
With this in mind we feel that it is important for those entering this lucrative field do not get blinded by high salaries and big bonuses, and want to create a deck for tech professionals to consult with so they can invest their well deserved cash into profitable real estate. Now, we understand that not all want a slow and steady investment opportunity, and that is why we designed our analysis accordingly. We understand that some want to see more immediate returns so they can cash in and cash out, and others want to accumulate wealth over time. We will be recommending the hottest localities for tech professionals to purchase real estate for both short term and long term gains.
